    \begin{itemize}
        \item The classifier is more accurate with higher SNR. \vfill

        \item Higher Order Modulations are more susceptible to misclassification. \vfill
            \begin{itemize}
            \item More spreading of constellation points makes similar with other \vfill
            \item 64 QAM and Noise are almost same \vfill
            \item Misclassification occurs between (16 QAM and 64 QAM), (AM and FM)\vfill

                \item Reduced Frequency Selectivity \vfill
                \item Lower tank circuit efficiency as energy not concentrated \vfill
                \item Unwanted phase noise because of larger bandwidth \vfill
